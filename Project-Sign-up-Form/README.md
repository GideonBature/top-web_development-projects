# Sign-up Form

This is a simple sign-up form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create an account by entering their information, such as first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password.

## Usage

To use the sign-up form, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The form interface will be displayed, and users can fill in their information and click the "Create Account" button to submit the form.

### Form Validation

The form includes the following validation rules:

- First Name and Last Name fields accept only alphabets and require at least 2 characters.
- Email field requires a valid email address.
- Phone Number field accepts only numbers and requires at least 11 digits.
- Password field requires at least 6 numbers.
- Confirm Password field must match the Password field.

If any of the validation rules are not met, an error message will be displayed below the form indicating the issue.

## CSS Styling

The form interface is styled using CSS. The main styles are defined in the `style.css` file. Here are some key styling properties:

- The form container is divided into two sections: an image section and a form content section.
- The image section displays a logo and a background image.
- The form content section includes a welcome message, form inputs, and a "Create Account" button.
- The form inputs are styled with appropriate dimensions and colors.
- The "Create Account" button has a custom background color and is styled to give a clickable appearance.

## Files

The form consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the form interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the form interface.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the form validation logic.

Feel free to modify and customize the sign-up form as needed!
